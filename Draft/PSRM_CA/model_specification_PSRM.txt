Models and simulations completed:

1. Main model
                                      
                                      
                                      
ERGM Models to Run with updated reciprocity, new covariates, and expanded DV:

1. Time-pooled models
2. Subset by missingness
	2a. Q=.5
	2b. Q=.25 
3. Imputed data models: I suggest not including these as I'm confident the zeros are 
						supposed to be zero and the subset by missingness models already 
						address the issue.
						Rough estimate is at least 24k core hours.
						(3 models x 11 years x 10 imputations x 72 hours)
4. Model with corporate tax rates
5. Model that drops tax havens
6. Model the drops EU countries
7. LSM with AMEN for main model
